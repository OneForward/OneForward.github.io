## Biography

I'm a Master student at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China. I received my B.S. degree in Automation, SJTU in 2019. My research interests include graph learning and graph-related fileds, like skeleton-based human pose estimation, semi- or un-supervised learning, recommendation system and relation extraction. **I'm currently seeking for PhD position.** 

<!-- an intern in the Department of Trust and Security  in ByteDance, researching on discovering abnormal accounts with graph-based strategies. -->
